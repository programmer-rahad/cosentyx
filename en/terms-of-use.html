        <div class="pp-item">

          <h4>1. Acceptance</h4>

          <p>

            Your access to and use of this site (the “Site”) is subject to the

            following terms and conditions (the “Terms of Use”) and all

            applicable laws. By accessing and browsing this Site, you accept,

            without limitation or qualification, these Terms of Use.

        <div class="pp-item">

          <h4>2. Medical information/conditions</h4>

          <p>

            Product information on this Site is provided by Novartis

            Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. and is intended for general information

            purposes only. This Site is intended for use in Canada only. Many

            pharmaceutical and medical device products listed are available upon

            prescription from a physician or qualified health care professional

            only, and not all such products may be available in all countries.

            The product information is not intended to provide complete medical

            information. SHOULD YOU HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION, PROMPTLY SEE YOUR

            OWN MEDICAL DOCTOR OR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. WE DO NOT OFFER

            PERSONALIZED MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR PATIENT-SPECIFIC TREATMENT ADVICE.

            You should always obtain complete medical information about your

            prescription medicines or medical devices (including their

            beneficial medical uses and possible adverse effects) by discussing

            the appropriate use of any medicine(s) or medical devices directly

            with your prescribing physician or, where appropriate, other medical

            advisor. Medical professionals may obtain complete medical

            information from the product’s information leaflet. Information on

            these products may vary by country. Patients, physicians and other

            medical professionals should check with local medical resources and

            regulatory authorities for information appropriate to their country.

            In addition, current regulations in many countries limit (or even

            prohibit in some instances) the ability of Novartis Pharmaceuticals

            Canada Inc. to provide information and/or to respond directly to

            patient questions regarding its prescription products. Novartis

            Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., however, will respond to inquiries from

            and provide information to your qualified health care professional

            in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
