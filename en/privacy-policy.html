          </h4>

          <p>

            Most of our services do not require any form of registration,

            allowing you to visit our site without telling us who you are.

            However, some services may require you to provide us with Personal

            Information, which may include your direct identifiers, such as

            name, birth date, email address or telephone number. We may collect

            and use Personal Information to provide you with products or

            services, to bill you for products and services you request, to

            market products and services which we think may be of interest to

            you, or to communicate with you for other purposes which are evident

            from the circumstances or about which we inform you when we collect

            Personal Information from you. <br />

            Personal Information used for website usage analytics: <br />

            We may collect and process information about your visit to this

            website, such as the pages you visit, the website you came from and

            some of the searches you perform. Such information is used by us to

            help improve the contents of the site and to compile aggregate

            statistics using our site for internal, market research purposes. In

            doing this, we may install “cookies” that collect the domain name of

            the user, your internet service provider, your operating system, and

            the date and time of access. A “cookie” is a small piece of

            information, which is sent to your browser and stored on your

            computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can

            set your browser to notify you when you receive a “cookie”, this

            will enable you to decide if you want to accept it or not. ,

            however, if you do not accept, you may not be able to use all

            functionalities of your browser software. We may also use external

            service providers to help us collect and process the information

            described in this section. <br />

            Occasionally, we may use internet tags (also known as action tags,

            singlepixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs and 1-by-1 GIFs) and

            cookies at this site and may deploy these tags/cookies through a

            third-party advertising partner or a web analytical service partner

            which may be located and store the respective information (including

            your IP-address) in a foreign country. These tags/cookies are placed

            on both online advertisements that bring users to this site and on

            different pages of this site. We use this technology to measure the

            visitors’ responses to our sites and the effectiveness of our

            advertising campaigns (including how many times a page is opened and

            which information is consulted) as well as to evaluate your use of

            this website. The third-party partner or the web analytical service

            partner may be able to collect data about visitors to our and other

            sites because of these internet tags/cookies, may compose reports

            regarding the website’s activity for us and may provide further

            internet. They may provide such information to other parties if

            there is a legal requirement that they do so, or if they hire the

            other parties to process information on their behalf. If you would

            on-line advertising or to opt-out of third-party collection of this

            services delivery, evaluating the usefulness of this website,

            marketing, data management, or technical support. <br />

            These third parties have contracted with us to only use Personal

            Personal Information collected from you may also be transferred to a

            third party in the event that the business of this site or a part of

            it and the customer data connected with it is sold, assigned or

            transferred, in which case we would require the buyer, assignee or

            transferee to treat Personal Information in accordance with this

            other jurisdictions, we will make sure to protect your Personal

            Information by applying the level of protection required under

            applicable data privacy laws. <br />

            For intra-group transfers of Personal Information, Novartis has

            adopted Binding Corporate Rules, a system of principles, rules, and

            tools, provided by European law, that ensures effective levels of

            data protection relating to transfers of Personal Information

            outside the EEA and Switzerland. Read more about the Novartis
